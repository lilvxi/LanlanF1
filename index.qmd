## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of fatal events in Formula 1 racing from 1950 to 2024. Through data visualization, statistical analysis, and interactive exploration, we examine patterns and factors associated with fatal incidents in the sport's history.

## Project Structure

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Data Preparation](step1_dataPreprocess.qmd) | Data sources, cleaning, and preprocessing |
| [Exploratory Visualization](step2_EDAViz.qmd) | Visual exploration of temporal trends, circuits, constructors, and driver factors |
| [Statistical Analysis](step3_inferStat.qmd) | Inferential statistics including chi-square tests, t-tests, ANOVA, and logistic regression |
| [Interactive Explorer](step4_shiny.qmd) | Shiny application for interactive data exploration |

## Key Findings

1. **Temporal Trends**: Fatal events have decreased dramatically since the 1980s
2. **Driver Factors**: Rookie drivers face higher risks; experience provides protection
3. **Circuit Characteristics**: Historic European circuits show higher fatality rates
4. **Safety Evolution**: Continuous improvements in regulations and car design have made F1 significantly safer
